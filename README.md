gohash is a simple concurrent file hashing program.
I wrote it to learn about golang. Thus far, lovin' everything about golang - these guys think the way I do. Take a look at the code; simple, elegant and reusable. Nice!

Supports the following hashes: md5, sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384, sha512.

Run the following to get help using this program.:
